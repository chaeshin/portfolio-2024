      <span>Hi, I'm Chaewan Shin(シン・チェワン) and I usually go by Chae in English.

      I am a curious full-stack engineer with a background in Architecture who is currently based in Tokyo.

      🔭 I’m currently developing web applications (personal projects) that streamline my daily tasks and routines. See the most recent app Form-Calisthenics I worked on with my team at Le Wagon Tokyo.

      🌱 I’m currently learning Python. Trained as an architectural designer, I used complex 3D software like Revit and Rhino, which support plugins and scripting with Python or C#. I am also interested in exploring what programming can bring to the Architecture and design fields.

      🍞 In my free time, I bake sourdough bread.
